# ES-116 Project Work 
### IoT-Based Smart Parking System Using Arduino and IR Sensors

A GitHub Repo for project work in the course ES 116: Principles and Application of Electrical Engineering (Spring, 2025), IIT Gandhinagar. 

## Overview
This project presents a low-cost, real-time smart parking solution using Arduino Uno and IR sensors. The system detects vehicle movement at entry and exit points, manages available slots dynamically, and operates a servo-based gate mechanism. An LCD display provides live feedback, showing current slot availability or a "Parking Full" message.

The prototype was designed with scalability in mind and can be expanded to handle multi-slot setups or integrated with cloud platforms for smart city applications.

### Components Used
- Arduino UNO  
- IR Sensors (Entry & Exit)  
- 16x2 LCD with I2C Module  
- Servo Motor  
- 5V Regulated Power Supply  
- Basic Wiring and Breadboard Setup
